Write an appropriate PHP script for following requirement:

A) Files Used : emp.php and emp.class.php

	- Combine functionalities of all files created previously by you, i.e., empadd.php, empdisp.php and 
	empmoddel.php into a single file called "emp.php" and its associated class file "emp.class.php".

	- This could be considered as an Application screen "Employee", which allows user 
		to either view, add, modify or delete employee details.

	- Also, display appropriate notification messages on the main display of the screen like
       "Record added successfully.", "Record updated successfully.", "Record deleted successfully." 
        in case of successfull completion of "Add", "Modify" and "Delete" operations respectively.
        In case of some problems, display notification messages like "Record NOT added successfully.",
       "Record NOT updated successfully.", "Record NOT deleted successfully.".

		HINT : Make use of 'switch' statement which will execute a specific case depending upon the 
		"doAction" value (a variable evaluated using 'switch' statement).
